### **Recommended Production Settings:**

```bash
NODE_ENV=production  # Auto-set by Railway
LOG_LEVEL=info
MCP_API_KEY=         # Leave blank for public access
ROBOTS_OBEY=true     # Respect robots.txt
```

## üí∞ Cost Estimates

### **Railway Pricing (2025):**

**Hobby Plan: $5/month**
- Includes $5 of usage credits
- If usage stays under $5, you only pay the subscription
- If usage exceeds $5, pay the difference

### **Estimated Costs for Torah MCP:**

**Light Usage** (10-50 queries/day):
- **Cost:** $5-6/month

**Moderate Usage** (100-200 queries/day):
- **Cost:** $6-8/month

**Heavy Usage** (500+ queries/day):
- **Cost:** $8-12/month

### **What Counts as "Usage":**
- CPU time per request
- Memory usage
- Network bandwidth
- Build time (minimal, only on deployments)

### **Free Trial:**
- Railway offers $5 one-time credits to try
- Valid for 30 days
- Perfect for testing before committing

## üîç Monitoring & Logs

### **View Logs:**

1. In Railway dashboard, click your service
2. Go to **Deployments** tab
3. Click on the active deployment
4. View real-time logs

**Useful log entries:**
```
Torah MCP running at http://localhost:XXXX/mcp
SSE connection established
Tool called: search
Tool called: fetch
```

### **View Metrics:**

Railway provides:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Network traffic
- Request count
- Error rates

**Built-in Dashboard:**
Visit your deployment at `/dashboard` to see:
- Total requests
- Average latency
- Tool usage counts
- Cache statistics
- Error counts

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Build Fails - "tsx: command not found"**

**Cause:** tsx not in dependencies

**Solution:**
Already fixed! tsx has been moved to dependencies in package.json.

---

### **Issue: "Application failed to respond"**

**Cause:** Server not binding to Railway's PORT

**Solution:**
Already configured! The server reads `process.env.PORT` automatically.

---

### **Issue: MCP Tools Not Working**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Sefaria API is down (check status.sefaria.org)
2. Rate limiting from Sefaria
3. Network timeout

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Test `/healthz` endpoint
3. Try MCP endpoint directly: `/mcp/sse/`

---

### **Issue: High Costs**

**Causes:**
- Too many requests
- Memory leaks
- Infinite loops

**Solutions:**
1. Check request logs in Railway dashboard
2. Add `MCP_API_KEY` to require authentication
3. Implement rate limiting (already built-in: 60 req/min)
4. Monitor `/dashboard` for unusual activity

---

### **Issue: SSL/HTTPS Errors**

**Cause:** Railway domains already have SSL

**Solution:**
No action needed! All Railway domains automatically have valid SSL certificates.

---

## üîÑ Updating Your Deployment

### **Auto-Deploy on Git Push:**

Railway automatically redeploys when you push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update MCP server"
git push origin main
```

Railway will:
1. Detect the push
2. Pull latest code
3. Rebuild
4. Deploy with zero downtime

### **Manual Redeploy:**

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click **"Redeploy"**
3. Confirm

---

## üìä Health Checks

Railway can monitor your app's health:

### **Configure Health Check:**

1. Railway dashboard ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Settings
2. Scroll to **Health Check**
3. Set:
   - **Path:** `/healthz`
   - **Port:** Same as PORT (Railway auto-detects)
   - **Interval:** 60 seconds

Railway will automatically restart your service if health checks fail.

---

## üåç Custom Domain (Optional)

Want to use your own domain instead of Railway's?

### **Steps:**

1. Buy a domain (e.g., torah-mcp.com)
2. In Railway: Settings ‚Üí Networking ‚Üí Custom Domain
3. Add your domain
4. Update your domain's DNS:
   - Type: `CNAME`
   - Name: `@` or `mcp`
   - Value: `YOUR-RAILWAY-DOMAIN.up.railway.app`

**Time to propagate:** 5 minutes - 24 hours

**New MCP Connector URL:**
```
https://torah-mcp.com/mcp/sse/
```

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

### **Public Deployment:**

If deploying publicly, consider:

1. **Add API Key Authentication:**
   ```bash
   MCP_API_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   ```
   Then users must provide this key to connect.

2. **Enable Rate Limiting:**
   Already built-in (60 requests/minute per IP)

3. **Obey Robots.txt:**
   ```bash
   ROBOTS_OBEY=true
   ```

4. **Monitor Logs:**
   Check for suspicious activity regularly

5. **Set Appropriate CORS:**
   Already configured for MCP protocol

---

## üìà Scaling

### **Vertical Scaling (More Resources):**

Railway auto-scales based on usage. If you need guaranteed resources:

1. Upgrade to **Pro Plan** ($20/month + usage)
2. Get priority resources and support

### **Horizontal Scaling:**

For very high traffic, you could:
1. Deploy multiple instances
2. Use a load balancer
3. Add Redis for shared caching

*Note: For most users, single instance is sufficient.*
