## **üìñ Installation & Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
Node.js >= 18.17.0
npm or yarn
```

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd torah-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

The server will be available at:
- **Torah MCP:** `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- **Web Research MCP:** `http://localhost:3000/mcp-web`

### **Configuration**
Set environment variables for enhanced functionality:
```bash
# OpenRouter API for AI-powered explanations
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENROUTER_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Sefaria API (usually automatic)
SEFARIA_MCP_URL=http://localhost:3000/mcp

# Web search providers (optional but recommended)
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_key_here
# SERPAPI_KEY=optional_fallback_key
# BRAVE_API_KEY=optional_fallback_key
```

### **Using with ChatGPT Connectors (Developer Mode)**

Create **two connectors** so GPT can call both the Sefaria tools and the web search/fetch bridge:

1. **Torah MCP (Sefaria tools)**
   - **MCP Server URL:** `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/mcp/sse/`
   - **Authentication:** None (leave blank)
   - **Allowed tools:** (select the ones you need, e.g., `search`, `fetch`, `sugya_explorer`, `find_refs`, etc.)
   - Check **‚ÄúI trust this application.‚Äù**

2. **Web Research MCP (search + fetch for GPT Deep Research)**
   - **MCP Server URL:** `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/mcp-web/sse/`
   - **Authentication:** None
   - **Allowed tools:** `search`, `fetch`
   - Check **‚ÄúI trust this application.‚Äù**

> **Important:** These URLs must be served over HTTPS and publicly reachable. The server accepts Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` and `/mcp-web`, and SSE for connectors at `/mcp/sse/` + `/mcp/messages` and `/mcp-web/sse/` + `/mcp-web/messages`.

> **Health check:** `GET https://YOUR_DOMAIN/healthz` returns JSON with uptime and counters.
